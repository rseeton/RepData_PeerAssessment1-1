## Loading and preprocessing the data
### 1. Load the data, checks that the activity.csv file is present.

```{r}
if (file.exists("activity.csv"))
{ 
	activity_data <- read.csv("activity.csv")
} else 
{
    return(message("Activity data files (activity.csv)"))
}
```
####    Quick review of the data
```{r}
summary(activity_data)
str(activity_data)
```
### 2. Aggregate total steps by day

```{r}
activity_steps_totals <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data=activity_data, FUN = function(x) c(totals=sum(x))) 
```

## Loading and preprocessing the data
####    Plot Histogram of Aggregate steps totals
```{r}
hist(activity_steps_totals$steps, main="Histogram for Activity - Total Steps by Day", xlab="Number of Steps", ylab="Number of Days", breaks="freedman-diaconis", col="red")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

##Mean number of Steps per Day: `{r}mean(activity_steps_totals$steps)`
###Median number of Steps per Day: `{r}median(activity_steps_totals$steps)`


## What is the average daily activity pattern?

### 3. Aggregate steps by interval
```
activity_steps_averages <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data=activity_data, FUN = function(x) c(average=mean(x))) 
```
#### Line plot of Steps per Interval
```
plot(activity_steps_averages$steps, type="l", col="blue", ylab="Number of Steps", xlab="Interval Number", main="Line Plot of Steps by 5 minute Intervals")
```

#### Interval with greatest average number of steps
####Interval #: `activity_steps_averages[which(activity_steps_averages$steps == max(activity_steps_averages$steps)),]`


## Imputing missing values

### Number of NA values
####Count NAs: `count_NA <- sum(is.na(activity_data$steps))`

### Repopulate NA's with arbitrary values...
#### Simplest approach is to use the average value from each timestep, as we have already calculated that value
```
activity_steps <- data.frame(activity_data$steps)
activity_steps[is.na(activity_steps),] <- ceiling(tapply(X=activity_data$steps,FUN=mean,INDEX=activity_data$interval, na.rm=TRUE))
activity_steps_imputted <- cbind(activity_steps, activity_data)
colnames(activity_steps_imputted) <- c("Steps_Imputted","Steps_Original", "Date", "Interval")

activity_steps_imputted_totals <- aggregate(Steps_Imputted ~ Date, data=activity_steps_imputted, FUN = function(x) c(totals=sum(x))) 
```

#### Plot Histogram
```
hist(activity_steps_imputted_totals$Steps_Imputted, 
	main="Histogram for Activity - Total Steps (with Imputted Values)", 
	xlab="Number of Steps", 
	ylab="Number of Days", 
	breaks="freedman-diaconis",
	col="pink")
```	
####Mean number of Steps per Day based on Imputted Data: `mean(activity_steps_imputted_totals$Steps_Imputted)`
####Median number of Steps per Day based on Imputted Data `median(activity_steps_imputted_totals$Steps_Imputted)`



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

### Add 'day' field to differentiate weekdays (0)  vs weekends (1)
```
tm1.lt <- as.POSIXlt(activity_data$date)
activity_data$day <- tm1.lt$wday
activity_data$day[activity_data$day <= 5] <- "0" # Day = 0 if Weekday
activity_data$day[activity_data$day > 5] <- "1"  # Day = 1 if Weekend

activity_steps_averages_by_weekday <- aggregate( data=activity_data, steps ~ day + interval, FUN=mean )

activity_data_weekdays <- activity_steps_averages_by_weekday[activity_steps_averages_by_weekday$day==0,]
activity_data_weekends <- activity_steps_averages_by_weekday[activity_steps_averages_by_weekday$day==1,]

old.par <- par(mfrow=c(2, 1))
plot(activity_data_weekends$steps,type="l", col="blue", ylab="Number of Steps", xlab="Interval Number", main="Line Plot of Steps by 5 minute Intervals - Weekends")
plot(activity_data_weekdays$steps,type="l", col="blue", ylab="Number of Steps", xlab="Interval Number", main="Line Plot of Steps by 5 minute Intervals - Weekdays")
par(old.par)
```
